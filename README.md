This app is based on the Dash Enterprise App Gallery "Oil & Gas Wells" example. 
https://dash.gallery/ddk-oil-and-gas-demo/

This app was re-written using dash-bootstrap-components and standard bootstrap class names by AnnMarieW.
https://github.com/AnnMarieW/HelloDash/tree/main/gallery/oil_and_gas

I have built upon their work to make this app compatible with Dash 2.0 and dash-bootstrap-components 1.0. Other colors have been updated for my personal preferences. This is only an example to show what Python & Dash are capable of.
